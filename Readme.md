Text Mode Asana
========================

Access the Asana task tracking tool via text mode / command line.

This is accomplished via Python module, in turn via the API. I want
this because the Asana web app is always running the CPU a fair amount
on one of my Raspberry Pis, any time I click a task, arrow up/down, or
even mouse over a task. The web app is not at all snappy or responsive
on this Raspberry Pi.
